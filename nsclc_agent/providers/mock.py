"""Offline mock provider.

Returns a deterministic, well-formed stub response without any network or API
key. This is what makes the toolkit runnable for teaching, CI and unit tests
out of the box: the full case → stage → route → prompt pipeline executes, and
only the final model call is stubbed. The stub echoes the routing/staging
context so the wiring is visible.
